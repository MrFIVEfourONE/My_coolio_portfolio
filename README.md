# My_coolio_portfolio
This will be a mobile responsive portfolio that someday will both matter and be comical as per its level of responsiveness.

I have utilized the Bootstrap Framework on both the About and Contact page, then took it upone myself to just use flexbox on my own terms to build the main part of the Gallary (portfolio.html)

I used a sticky footer and a Nav Bar complements of bootstrap on all three pages.

All three pages checked out on a validaion service:
