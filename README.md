# My_coolio_portfolio

This will be a mobile responsive portfolio that someday will both matter and be comical as per its level of responsiveness.

I have utilized the Bootstrap Framework on both the About and Contact page, then took it upon myself to just use flexbox on my own terms to build the main part of the Gallary (portfolio.html)

I used a sticky footer and a Nav Bar complements of bootstrap on all three pages.

All three pages checked out on a validaion service:

<img src=/assets/images/indexvalidation.jpg>
<img src=/assets/images/portvalidation.jpg>
<img src=/assets/images/contactvalidation.jpg>

this was a fun experiance and I feel like I could go far when im finally released into the wild and left to my own devices.

Using the Validation service certanly kept my html in check, and i believe using that from here on out will help me build on the foundation of proper HTML.

Hope you injoy it as much as I did.. time for some JS (;
